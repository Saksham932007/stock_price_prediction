# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction using LSTM (Colab Ready)

This project implements a stock price prediction pipeline using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks** in TensorFlow/Keras.  
It is designed to run seamlessly in **Google Colab**, making it easy to experiment, train, and evaluate models on financial time-series data.
